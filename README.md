# devops-lifecycle
A repository to express my understanding of the principles of DevOps and its lifecycle

## Definition
DevOps represents a cultural and operational shift merging development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to accelerate delivery cycles, enable continuous deployment, and ensure superior software quality. This approach combines collaboration, optimized practices, and integrated toolchains to eliminate organizational barriers.

## Foundational Principles
- **Collaboration**: Collective ownership, mutual understanding, non-blaming incident reviews, and cross-team transparency.  
- **Process Automation**: Streamline repetitive tasks (CI/CD pipelines, IaC, testing) to minimize errors and enhance deployment velocity.  
- **Perpetual Continuity (CI/CD)**: CI (regular code integrations with automated validation), CD (release-ready software), persistent testing, and real-time monitoring.  
- **Measurement and Feedback**: Analyze metrics (system performance, failure rates) to rapidly resolve issues and refine processes.  
- **Knowledge Dissemination**: Share expertise, documentation, and successful methodologies across departments.  

## lifeycle (Iterative Loop)
1. **Plan**: Jointly define specifications and roadmap features.  
2. **Code**: Develop using version control systems (e.g., Git).  
3. **Build**: Package code into executable units via automated CI.  
4. **Test**: Conduct comprehensive automated verification (security, load, functional).  
5. **Release**: Finalize versioned packages for distribution.  
6. **Deploy**: Automate environment provisioning and software rollout using IaC.  
7. **Operate**: Maintain production system reliability and resources.  
8. **Monitor**: Track live performance and user engagement; channel insights to planning.  

## Conclusion
The integration of these principles and lifecycle establishes a responsive, high-efficiency delivery mechanism for consistent, premium software solutions.
